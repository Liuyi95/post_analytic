I made it 15 minutes- maybe. I honestly thought the whole thing was written and directed by AI or something. I’m insulted this movie exists.', 'Sadly I was very disappointed with this one… It wasn‘t that scary and it wasn‘t exciting. The biggest problem with these movies are the bland characters (with the exception of Poirot), I hate how  a lot of these backstories are just pure exposition…', 'Saw it this evening. Loved Branagh&#39;s Orient Express, really liked his Death on the Nile, &amp; loved this adaptation of Hallowe&#39;en Party. End left me shattered &amp; in tears. Major influences are Don&#39;t Look Now (Nicolas Roeg, 1973, which this film lifted a great deal from), &amp; Eyes Wide Shut (Stanley Kubrick, 1999; its costuming &amp; production design influence this film). The scary jump shots seem fake until Branagh has you by the throat, at which point they&#39;re straight out of an LSD hallucination. Best thing about this film: the casting, which could not be bettered. Yeoh convinced me the ghosts were real.', 'I saw this film last night. I found Branagh&#39;s excessively stylistic direction jarring and annoying. The number of unnecessary jump scares was ridiculous. I think he gave his ego priority over our entertainment. Some of the characters also over-acted under his direction. Michelle Yeoh (whose role was much too short) and the cinematography of Venice were the best things about this movie. I would rate it 2.5 out of 5.', 'Boring ass movie', 'I wonder about his framing sometimes.  He&#39;s clearly making an effort to disorient the viewer, but there is a convention to frame conversations where both conversants are on the outside third of a frame unless there is some unspoken connection to them.  This happens haphazardly throughout the film with opaque motivation.  He&#39;s a good filmmaker, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a mistake, but I don&#39;t understand the idea. Also, I think the movie suffers from not giving a full picture of, at least the main floor.  The geography is important.  At one point, it makes no sense, because of a reveal.  Still, I am a a &quot;locked door mystery&quot; afficionado, and there were some reveals I thought were legitimate.  Acting great throughout.  Tina Fey did a real, legitimate job here.', 'I went in blind and I thought this was part of the “Haunting in Connecticut”  movie line until I saw the detective. I also like mysteries but yeah the marketing felt off', 'Chris Sussman is a hack', 'Tina Fey played the same character from only murders in the building lol', 'There was a family with 3 children ranging 16 - 20. Otherwise my friend and I (31 &amp; 32) were the youngest people there 😆', 'I did not find the film scary.  It was interesting that a murderer was trying to use the supernatural to cover up the murder.', 'Great review as always Chris! I haven&#39;t seen the movie but heard similar comments about the marketing/production behind it misunderstanding the identity of the film as quite a few people I know who watched this were expecting a horror film and while they enjoyed the murder mystery, were quite unamused by the weak attempts at horror throughout. A shame because it otherwise looks really interesting!<br><br>If you&#39;re able to, watch Past Lives. IMO the best film of 2023.']"

A Haunting in Venice Ending Explained | Book Changes | Spoilers,EaR6PjTsFWo,4938,143,0,27,0,2023-09-14T07:18:36Z,"['I really enjoyed the movie but it had nothing to do with the actual story.  Well some of the names were the same and that’s about it. <br>David Suchet and Zoe Wanamaker did a great adaptation of the original story. This one was new and original and I liked it a lot. Just not Agatha Christie', 'Personally, I liked both versions, but the whole &quot;loosely based on the book&quot; is no joke. I highly suggest reading the book (although perhaps not the BEST of Agatha&#39;s novels, it is certainly my favorite so far, and I&#39;ve read about half of them), but if you want a quick summary of the important points of the book, I&#39;ll list a quick summary of the important parts of the original novel down below.<br><br>SPOILER WARNING AHEAD!<br><br><br><br>Ariadne Oliver is invited as a guest of honor to a halloween party. There, thirteen year old Joyce Reynolds claims to have witnessed a murder when she was younger, but didn&#39;t realize it until she was older. Other children call her a liar, and her behavior in defending herself does seem like she&#39;s lying; but later, she is found drowned in the apple bobbing attraction, indicating SOMEONE believed her statement. Ariadne (having appeared in &quot;Cards on the Table&quot; and a few other Poirot novels) asks for Poirot to help her in finding out who killed Joyce, and the two set off for information. A few key points to keep in mind are as follows:<br><br>-Joyce was a known liar.<br>-Leopold suddenly came into a fortune.<br>-There are four different unusual deaths/unsolved murders in the area (only the death of Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe and the stabbing of Leslie Ferrier are the key victims for this case).<br>-Miss Emlyn thought that Rowena Drake might have seen something in the hallway to startle her, causing her to drop a large vase full of flowers and water. (Keep in mind, the library where the apple bobbing game was held was down the hallway.)<br><br>Later, Poirot determines that Joyce was probably lying about having witnessed a murder, but it leaves open the question, &quot;Why did someone believe her?&quot; Later, Leopold is also found drowned by the brook, leading to the conclusion that he DID know, or at least had a decent guess, of who killed his sister, Joyce (in the book, they are related and Leopold dies). Rowena does confirm Ms. Emlyn&#39;s statement that she DID see something that startled her: Leopold was in the library at the time she dropped the vase. Eventually a few more key characters are interviewed and the suspicions around Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe death resurface.<br><br>-Judith Butler, who was at the party and is Ms. Oliver&#39;s friend.<br>-Miranda Butler, friend of Joyce and was home sick the night of the party.<br>-Michael Garfield, a man described of having an unusual sense of beauty, and (despite his arrogance) an impossible suspect due to him having not been at the party the day of Joyce&#39;s murder.<br><br>The details of Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe&#39;s death, and the disappearance of her au pair, Olga, are eventually brought out into the open. Olga was accused of having forged Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe&#39;s last will, and having been a crude forgery, was immediately dissmissed. Olga insisted she didn&#39;t forge the will, and planned to run away to Turkey, for fear of prosecution of the forgery and potential murder. Eventually, the house and the garden of Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe went to Michael for his work in the garden, and he in turn sold it, but still works on it. Poirot eventually gets an idea as to where Olga might be, and his suspicions turn out correct. Olga&#39;s corpse is found at the bottom of an abandoned well, stabbed in a similar manner to Leslie from before, and Poirot puts together what all happened.<br><br>It turns out, Olga was the murdered victim that Joyce claimed to have seen before. However, it was Miranda Butler who actually saw the murder, or more accurately, two people dragging her corpse to the well. One of them thought someone was watching them, hence why they believed Joyce actually did see their disposal of the body. (It&#39;s never directly confirmed if they killed Llewellyn-Smythe or if she actually died of natural causes.) The reason they killed her was because Olga ratted out Llewellyn-Smythe&#39;s niece as having had an affair, thus resulting Llewellyn-Smythe&#39;s last will being changed. The niece and her partner then made an obvoously forged will to discredit Olga, and then killed her to make it seem like she was guilty and running away.<br><br>Poirot knows that Miranda is in serious danger, and advises Ms. Oliver and Judith to take her far away from the area for the time being. Although they get her some distance away, an older man succeeds in leading her away when she steps off on her lonesome to the restroom while she, her mother, and Ariadne are out eating together. She and the man arrive at a sacrifice altar, and are about to partake in a ritual, but Poirot enlisted the help of two young men to keep watch and make sure Miranda stayed safe. They intervene at the last moment, saving Miranda&#39;s life.<br><br>Later, Miranda is discussing the details of the murder she witnessed, having not realized it was a murder due to the fact the Michael Garfield, the man that Llewellyn-Smythe&#39;s niece -- Rowena Drake -- was going to forsake her invalid husband for, had told her it was merely a sacrifice. Miranda confirms she told Joyce, and Leopold might have guessed or overheard their conversation. Since Miranda wasn&#39;t at the party that night, Joyce told everyone that SHE had seen the murder. In a final twist, Poirot reveals that Miranda&#39;s father was none other than Michael Garfield. Although he loved his daughter (having been seen earlier drawing a portrait of her), he wasn&#39;t above murdering her to keep the secret. As for Rowena and Michael, Poirot theorizes that, having bought a small Greecian island with Rowena&#39;s ill-gained fortune, Michael probably would have ended up killing Rowena anyways just so he wouldn&#39;t be under her thumb. As for figuring out that it was Rowena who killed Joyce, Poirot reveals he figured this fact rather early because of the fact that Rowena was wet, claiming to have spilt the vase on her; however, by drowning a victim, the killer would naturally be wet, and Rowena was the only person to be wet at the time of the murder.<br><br><br><br>In the end, I found this novel to be really fascinating. I missed the fact that Rowena had to logically be the killer because I was so fascinated with the backstory of the novel. Seriously, I would suggest reading the novel JUST to see how different it is from the movie. I woul LOVE to see this novel adapted into a play or something, it was that much of an enjoyment.', 'I might have missed something, but how did they explain a psychic lady speaking with the voice of the dead daughter and who did Poirot see in the mirror?', 'Watched it at the cinema on Monday... lovely escapism ..dont take it too seriously and you will enjoy', 'just saw this <br>10 little Indians I&#39;d like to see made .', 'Just saw it, not really a theater movie more of a good HBO movie', 'I think do evil under the sun in 1953', 'I always liked Ariadne Oliver, as an obviously ironic self-insert of Agatha Christie herself.', 'What an age for murder mystery: The only people eager to socialize at all always had sinister plans, hidden agendas, and ulterior motives!!!    🤗', 'this gonna be a hit', 'We appreciate your insights on a Haunting in Venice.

I say this is a good move to try for the other audiences who have never and never will read Agatha Christie&#39;s books and hopefully we can get more of these. One I wished Branagh did though if Poirot was in retirement was the iconic and most BRILLIANT of the few Christie&#39;s books I&#39;ve listened to is The Murder of Roger Ackroyd!

I like this title change and direction anyway cause imagine tbat other non book audience who probably wouldn’t be as enthusiastic tp watch a movie with the original title and at a Hallowe&#39;en Party so gotta make it different and perhaps the same idea with the murdered child at the party, only it&#39;s written differently in this.
